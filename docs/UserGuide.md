## Introduction

Welcome to Coinflip! Instead of becoming addicted to spending real money on App Store games
betting on loot boxes, learn how gambling eventually leads to ruin in a safe, controlled and fun environment.

Coinflip simulates a gambling environment using a simple coin flip game,
but takes away the risk and danger of actual gambling.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java ```17``` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your coinflip programme.
4. Open a command terminal, ```cd``` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the ```java -jar tp.jar```
   command to run the programme.
5. Type in a command and press Enter to execute it.  
   Some example commands you can try:
    - ```help```: Shows a list of executable commands
    - ```check balance```: Checks remaining balance
    - ```check bet```: Checks betting amount
    - ```exit```: Terminates programme

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q**: Are there any keyboard inputs I should avoid?

**A**: Yes, avoid using **modifier keys**, such as Shift, Ctrl, Cmd, Win and Alt in your commands (e.g. Ctrl-Z), as
these inputs may not be parsed by the program correctly, leading to erratic but expected behaviour. Due to said
behaviour differing across operating systems, we do not currently plan to make the program handle such cases; we've
opted to document it in this user guide instead.

**Q**: Can I place extra words after my commands? (e.g. `check bet yay`)

**A**: No, they will be rejected as invalid commands.

**Q**: Can I bet with 0 coins? Can I bet when I have 0 coins?

**A**: The answer to both questions is **yes**. If you find yourself continuing to flip, even when you know
it's a futile endeavour, you're addicted! Use this experience to think about how dangerously addictive gambling is.

However, if you'd like to share Coinflip, or try different strategies under the belief that "there's a way to win",
you can reset your coin balance using the `reset` command.

**Q**: Will my data be automatically saved when I exit the program?

**A**: Yes, it will be saved in a save file.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: When you start Coinflip for the first time, there will be a `data` folder
in the same directory as Coinflip's .jar file.
Transfer this folder to the same directory as the .jar on the other computer,
and your save data will be transferred.

**Q**: Can I edit the save file?

**A**: Yes, the user data is stored in a .csv file in the `data` folder.
However, if our program detects that the save file is corrupted or in an incorrect format,
it will ignore the save file and start a new game. This is not a bug.
Additionally, while the user can edit the save file, they are not recommended to do so.
This is because changing the values in the save file, for example the balance, would
defeat the purpose of the game, which is to simulate gambling and allow the user to
experience its consequences.

**Q**: If I swap column labels in the save file, will the data still be loaded correctly?

**A**: The column labels in the first line of the .csv file are there for the user to have
a reference for the correct ordering of data in subsequent rows.

If the user swaps the column labels, the program will still load data according to the
original column order, and the save file will overwrite the column labels to the original state upon the next save.

Since there is no reason to require them swapped, this is not a bug.

**Q**: What is the correct format for the save file?

**A**: The second row contains a sequence of numbers corresponding to their column labels. As a reference, you can start
Coinflip and look at the save file. There are also additional restrictions:

* All values must be separated using commas `,` without spaces between them
* All values must be non-negative integers typed out numerically (e.g. `50`, not `fifty`)
* All values must be lower than 10 digits in length
* Either the `Current Win Streak` or `Current Lose Streak` value must be 0.
* `Highest Win Streak` must be equal to or greater than `Current Win Streak`.
* `Highest Lose Streak` must be equal to or greater than `Current Lose Streak`.

If these conditions are not met, the program will attempt to detect the file corruption, but it is not guaranteed
to do so, and this is expected behaviour.

The reason is that the text commands already provide all expected user functionality, and the program creates
correctly formatted save files, so handling user modification is out of scope.

**Q**: What happens if I played such that my balance exceeds 9 digits in length? E.g. `1000000000`

**A**: It will be capped at `999999999` if it exceeds `999999999`. The same goes for all other numerical values shown in
the game.

**Q**: Why does `"Warning: Coinflip could not save your save file! Your progress will not be saved."` appear?

**A**: This is likely due to your save file being open while you run the program and is to be expected.
It is not a bug. Please close your save file and try again. Alternatively, the warning could have appeared if you have
changed the properties of the .csv file to read-only (but why would you... right?)
