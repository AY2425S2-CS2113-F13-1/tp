## Overview

Coinflip is a desktop CLI (Command Line Interface) app for betting in-game currency on coin flips and learning about the
dangers of gambling. The target user are 12-15 year old teenagers, who are most susceptible to the manipulative
strategies game creators use to financially gain from players.
